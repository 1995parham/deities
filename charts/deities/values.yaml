  # Controller configuration

    # Registries configuration (define registry addresses and authentication)
    #
    # You can provide authentication credentials in two ways:
    #
    # 1. Direct values (simple, good for development):
    #    registries:
    #      - name: "https://registry-1.docker.io"
    #        auth:
    #          username: "myuser"
    #          password: "mypassword"
    #
    # 2. From a Kubernetes secret (recommended for production):
    #    registries:
    #      - name: "https://gcr.io"
    #        auth:
    #          secretRef:
    #            name: gcr-credentials
    #            usernameKey: username  # optional, defaults to "username"
    #            passwordKey: password  # optional, defaults to "password"
    #
    # When using secretRef, the chart will automatically inject the credentials
    # as environment variables and configure the application to use them.
    #
    # Example with both methods:
    # registries:
    #   - name: "https://registry-1.docker.io"  # Docker Hub (no auth)
    #   - name: "https://gcr.io"
    #     auth:
    #       secretRef:
    #         name: gcr-credentials
    #   - name: "https://my-registry.example.com"
    #     auth:
    #       username: "myuser"
    #       password: "mypassword"
    registries:
      - name: "https://registry-1.docker.io"

    # Images to monitor (each image references a registry)
    # Example:
    # images:
    #   - name: "nginx"
    #     registry: "https://registry-1.docker.io"
    #     tag: "latest"
    #   - name: "nginx"
    #     registry: "https://registry-1.docker.io"
    #     tag: "stable"
    #   - name: "myorg/myapp"
    #     registry: "https://registry-1.docker.io"
    #     tag: "main"
    images: []

    # Deployments to manage
    # Example:
    # deployments:
    #   - name: "nginx-deployment"
    #     namespace: "default"
    #     container: "nginx"
    #     image: "nginx"
    #   - name: "myapp-deployment"
    #     namespace: "production"
    #     container: "app"
    #     image: "myorg/myapp"
    deployments: []

# Additional environment variables to pass to the deities container
# These can be used to override configuration values via environment variables
# Environment variables should use the format: deities_section__key
# Example:
# extraEnv:
#   - name: deities_logger__level
#     value: "debug"
#   - name: deities_controller__check_interval
#     value: "10m"
#   - name: GCR_JSON_KEY

#       secretKeyRef:
#         name: gcr-credentials
#         key: json-key
